# Metronome JS
## Experimental metronome project built with JavaScript and CSS

As a new developer, I am looking to build my JavaScript skills. As a drummer, I have a particular interest in having a JavaScript metronome tool that can be used in any browser.

## Project Goals
1. Use as much vanilla JS as possible. I anticipate being unable to avoid using other JS libraries for some feature, though
2. Display the current beat
3. Display two indicators
..* The first will flash on beat 1
..*The second will flash on beat 2"]
