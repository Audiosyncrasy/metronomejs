# Metronome JS
## Experimental metronome project built with JavaScript and CSS

As a new developer, I am looking to build my JavaScript skills. As a drummer, I have a particular interest in having a JavaScript metronme tool that can be used in any browser.

## Project Goals
goals = ["Use as much vanilla JS as possible. I anticipate being unable to avoid using other JS libraries for some feature, though" , "Display the current beat", "Display two indicators: the first will flash on beat 1, the second will flash on beat 2"]
